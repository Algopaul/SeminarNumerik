  title: Hypocoercivity and hypocontractivity of linear evolution equations
  abstract: For the class of linear semi-dissipative Hamiltonian ordinary differential equations or differential-algebraic equations (continuous or discrete time), the concepts of stability, asymptotic stability, hypocoercivity and hypocontractivity are discussed and related to concepts from control theory.

    In the finite dimensional case, on the basis of staircase forms, the short-time solution behavior is characterized and connected to the hypocoercivity index of these evolution equations.
    
    The results are applied to the analysis of  flow problems.

    Joint work with Franz Achleitner and Anton Arnold.

  title: A numerical method with the posteriori error estimates for fractional integro-differential equations
  abstract: This talk is concerned with obtaining a numerical solution of fractional integro-differential equations by constructing a matrix-collocation method involving the Hermite polynomial and matrix expansions of terms. The method is equipped with the collocation points and Caputo sense is used to describe the fractional derivatives. Having gathered all matrix compounds into a matrix equation, the fractional integro-differential equation is converted to a linear system of algebraic equations including the unknown Hermite coefficients. With the solving of the system, the desired numerical solution is immediately obtained. For sake of ensuring the efficiency and precision of the method, a test case is given and the error analysis is considered.

  title: Port-Hamiltonian Systems with Time-Delays
  abstract: An appealing approach to model, simulate and control complex multiphysics systems is using port-Hamiltonian (pH) systems. These systems have several advantages for example they are passive, inherently stable, robust in numerical integration and they can be easily linked together yielding a new pH system.
    In the last few decades, pH models were developed for standard systems, descriptor systems and infinite dimensional systems. However, a pH formulation for systems with time delay is not yet available.
    In the standard case we have an equivalence between being a pH system, being passive or fulfilling the Kalman-Yakubovich-Popov (KYP) inequality. Moreover, we can use the KYP inequality to construct a pH system explicitly. The time-delayed system  can be reinterpreted as an infinite dimensional system. For which there is also a passivity equivalent KYP inequality . In this talk, we use the infinite dimensional KYP inequality to formulate a pH system for time-delayed systems in a similar way to the standard case. Furthermore, we present conditions and properties which have to hold for these systems.

  title: Spectral approximation of Lyapunov operator equations with applications in high dimensional non-linear feedback control.
  abstract: Optimal feedback control for nonlinear systems is a powerful tool for many applications in engineering, physics and many other fields. The drawback of such approach is that the numerical treatment of the resulting nonlinear first order partial differential equation - the Hamiltion-Jacobi-Bellman equation (HJB) - can be difficult. One major reason for that being the high dimensionality of the state space for almost all problems of interest. In this talk it will be shown, that the HJB is linked to the operator Lyapunov equation. For this connection we'll need to define weighted Lp-spaces and take a closer look at semigroups and their properties to pave the way for a useful numerical scheme. Which will be - together with some numerical experiments - shortly introduced at the end.
