Linear time-varying differential-algebraic equations with symmetries are studied.
The structures that we address are self-adjoint and skew-adjoint systems. Local and global canonical forms under congruence are presented and used to classify the geometric properties of the flow associated with the differential equation as symplectic or generalized orthogonal flow.  As applications, the results are applied to the analysis of dissipative Hamiltonian systems arising from circuit simulation and incompressible flow.
