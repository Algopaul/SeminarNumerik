In this talk we consider a class of pH operators which appear in the modeling
of transmission networks (e.g. gas or electrical).
First, we study under which assumption we can guarantee
exponential stability and derive a power balance equation.
Afterwards it is shown that Kirchhoff-type interconnections
preserve the system class and we apply the results to electrical transmission line networks.

This talk is based on a joint work with Dorothea Hinsen (TU Berlin).
