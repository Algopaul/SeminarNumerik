Many real processes can be described by mathematical models. Since these representations are usually based on idealized assumptions and simplifications, it is nearly impossible to describe a system perfectly. Another problem arises from the fact that often the state of the actual system is not available, 
instead only the output can be obtained. This data is measured by devices like microphones and heat sensors. One approach to recovering an approximation of the state of the system is to design a dynamical observer. While the Kalman filter offers an efficient solution to this problem for linear systems, the design of non linear observers is still challenging. 
This talk gives an introduction to the minimum energy estimator (also called Mortensen observer) which was proposed among others by R. E. Mortensen in '68. The method approaches the problem via an optimal control problem minimizing the energy. We further discuss the mathematical challenges of providing feasible assumptions to ensure the well posedness of the resulting equation.
