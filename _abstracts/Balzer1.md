In this work, we consider a fast-slow system of mean-field coupled semiconductor lasers. We investigate the recently observed new phenomenon: a canard cascading, which consist of a recurrent motion where the orbit spends repeatedly time following distinct unstable parts of the slow manifold. Thereby, we describe explicitly the critical manifold and examine its stability properties. In addition, the fast subsystems are shown to possess heteroclinic connections. They determine the possible transitions between unstable parts of the slow manifold, making them play a key role in the formation of the phenomenon. Eventually, the heterogeneity of lasers is identified as the necessary condition for the phenomenon.
