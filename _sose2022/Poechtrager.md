In modern simulation applications in the automotive industry, the importance of multiphysical system simulation continues to grow. The simulation of hybrid, battery and fuel cell electric vehicle applications requires the coupling of electrical, mechanical, fluid, and thermal networks. Each network is established by combining the connection structure of a graph with physical equations of elementary components and resulting in a differential algebraic equation (DAE). To speed up the simulation a non-iterative multirate time integration co-simulation method for the system of coupled DAEs is established. The power of the multirate method is shown via representative examples.
