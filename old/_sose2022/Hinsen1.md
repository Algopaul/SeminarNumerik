The relation between passive and positive real systems has been extensively studied
in the literature. In this talk, we look at their connection to port-Hamiltonian descriptor systems. It is well-known that port-Hamiltonian systems are passive and that passive systems are positive real. Hence it is studied under which assumptions the converse implications hold. Furthermore, the relationship
between passivity, KYP inequalities, and finite available storage is investigated.

This talk is based on a [preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.04990) of the same name written by Karim Cherifi, Hannes Gernandt, and D.H.
