For the class of linear semi-dissipative Hamiltonian ordinary differential equations or differential-algebraic equations (continuous or discrete time), the concepts of stability, asymptotic stability, hypocoercivity and hypocontractivity are discussed and related to concepts from control theory.
In the finite dimensional case, on the basis of staircase forms, the short-time solution behavior is characterized and connected to the hypocoercivity index of these evolution equations.

The results are applied to the analysis of  flow problems.

Joint work with Franz Achleitner and Anton Arnold
