We discuss extensions for our previously developed framework SOBMOR: **S**tructured **O**ptimization-**B**ased **M**odel **O**rder **R**eduction. SOBMOR is a framework for structure-preserving model order reduction (MOR) of port-Hamiltonian (pH) systems, i.e. it approximates pH models that have a large state dimension with pH reduced order models (ROMs) with small state dimension. In the first part of the talk we revisit the original SOBMOR algorithm. This includes the parameterization of pH systems and the optimization of the ROM parameters.

In the second part we show how the optimization-based approach of SOBMOR can be used to solve a broader range
of problems. These include (i) the MOR of pH descriptor systems or even general parametric systems, (ii) the identification of pH systems from noisy data, and (iii) the structured H-infinity control of pH systems.
