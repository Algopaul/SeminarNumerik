# Todo-List for Seminar

## Pre-Semester
0. generate a new collection like `sose2023` by adding a new folder `_sose2023` to the root of this git-repository and adding the collection name `sose2023` in the `_config.yml` file.
1. Enter all possible seminar dates of the semester in a markdown table in `index.md`
2. Ask your boss about
  1. dates that should be blocked (remove them from the table)
  2. Guests he intends to invite (and give them early access to the seminar dates) and for extra students that are expected to present this semester
3. After adding the guests, ask the group (and additional students) to fill out some kind of a doodle-poll with their preferred talk-dates and generate the schedule, which is entered into the table on `index.md`

## During the semester (Weekly)

1. Ask the speakers one week before their talk to send you their abstract and title and add it in the correct format as markdown file to the correct collection (see e.g.\ [example-abstract-file](https://github.com/Algopaul/SeminarNumerik/blob/2c18aa6d2f76f14319c80c435318f3cce72cd98a/_abstracts/Balzer1.md))
2. 3 days before the seminar, send out the seminar-email. An HTML announcement mail can be generated by running
```
cd 'YOURPATH'/SeminarNumerik/
echo "---\n layout: mail\n session: $1 \n zoomlink: https://tu-berlin.zoom.us/j/YOURZOOMLINK \n---" > mail.md
bundle exec jekyll build
cd _site
juice --preserve-important true --remove-style-tags false --web-resources-images false mail.html mailout.html
cat mailout.html | xclip -selection clipboard
```
For this you must have `juice` and `xclip` installed.
3. Inform yourself about the speakers, give a polite introduction, and handle the questions during the seminar.
