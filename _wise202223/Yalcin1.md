This talk is concerned with obtaining a numerical solution of fractional integro-differential equations by constructing a matrix-collocation method involving the Hermite polynomial and matrix expansions of terms. The method is equipped with the collocation points and Caputo sense is used to describe the fractional derivatives. Having gathered all matrix compounds into a matrix equation, the fractional integro-differential equation is converted to a linear system of algebraic equations including the unknown Hermite coefficients. With the solving of the system, the desired numerical solution is immediately obtained. For sake of ensuring the efficiency and precision of the method, a test case is given and the error analysis is considered.
