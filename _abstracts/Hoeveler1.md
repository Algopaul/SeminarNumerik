Optimal feedback control for nonlinear systems is a powerful tool for many applications in engineering, physics and many other fields. The drawback of such approach is that the numerical treatment of the resulting nonlinear first order partial differential equation - the Hamiltion-Jacobi-Bellman equation (HJB) - can be difficult. One major reason for that being the high dimensionality of the state space for almost all problems of interest. In this talk it will be shown, that the HJB is linked to the operator Lyapunov equation. For this connection we'll need to define weighted Lp-spaces and take a closer look at semigroups and their properties to pave the way for a useful numerical scheme. Which will be - together with some numerical experiments - shortly introduced at the end.
