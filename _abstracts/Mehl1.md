The problem of computing the eigenvalues of the regular part of a
singular matrix pencil is a challenging problem. In this talk, we show
how results from the theory of low rank perturbations can be used
to obtain numerical algorithms to solve this problem.

The talk is based on joint work with Michiel Hochstenbach and Bor Plestenjak.
